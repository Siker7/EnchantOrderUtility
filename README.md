# EnchantOrderUtility
My first project to learn programming/kotlin. 
Meant to give the most xp-efficient order to apply a user-defined set of enchantments to an item in Minecraft. 
Will also allow for user-generated lists of enchantments (i.e. enchantments introduced by mods not included in the base game)


Right now my biggest problem is that I'm pretty sure what little functionality the program does have is extremely messy. I'd like to learn what the "best practices" version of what I've built would look like, so I can understand more about programming and Kotlin, and so I can do better in the future.
